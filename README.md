# tech_titans_trigger
Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to develop an Android-based solution that enables one mobile device (Trigger Device) to remotely activate another mobile device (Target Device) to capture camera feed and GPS data. The captured data will be sent to a cloud-based server over mobile data for storage and retrieval.
Functional Requirements:
1. Trigger Device: Develop an Android application for the Trigger Device that allows users to send a remote activation signal to the Target Device.
2. Target Device: Develop an Android application for the Target Device that listens for the remote activation signal and starts capturing camera feed and GPS data upon receipt.
3. Data Transmission: Implement a mechanism to transmit the captured camera feed and GPS data from the Target Device to a cloud-based server over mobile data.
4. Cloud-Based Server: Utilize a freely available hosting service (e.g., Firebase, AWS) for backend storage and retrieval of the captured data.
5. Data Retrieval: Develop a mechanism for users to retrieve and view the captured data from the cloud-based server.
Non-Functional Requirements:
1. Security: Ensure that all data transmitted between devices and the cloud-based server is encrypted and secure.
2. Reliability: Ensure that the system is reliable and can handle network failures and device disconnections.
3. Scalability: Design the system to scale with an increasing number of users and devices.
4. User Experience: Ensure that the user interface is intuitive and easy to use.
